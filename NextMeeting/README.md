Correctly calculating log likelihood
----------

I used the corrected log likelihood formula we discussed last meeting:

Issues: 
1. My current solution is computationally ineffecient, since, for the penalization term, I am not collapsing over V_i and cluster combinations. Better steps?


Results
---------
We see an decrease in negative log likelihood:
